# Cursor

`cursor` tells CMR GraphQL that you'd like to fetch the `search-after` identifier out of the response header with the intent of harvesting data (or fetching multiple pages of results). To take advantage of the cursor you can then include it in subsequent queries until no data is returned.

First Request

```graphql
{
  concept {
    count
    cursor
    items {
      conceptId
    }
  }
}
```

Which will return something similar to the following:

```graphql
{
  "data": {
    "concept": {
      "count": 2483,
      "cursor": "eyJqc29uIjoiLTQ2OTA0MDY3NyJ9=",
      "items": [
        {
          "conceptId": "C1000000001-EXAMPLE"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Subsequent Requests

```graphql
{
  concept(params: { cursor: "eyJqc29uIjoiLTQ2OTA0MDY3NyJ9=" }) {
    count
    cursor
    items {
      conceptId
    }
  }
}
```

Here are some things to keep in mind when using a cursor:

1. Subsequent queries require that the same search parameters are sent to ensure that the same query is performed.
2. Subsequent queries must be made sequentially (as of August 21, 2020) as the version of Elastic Search CMR uses does not support parallel queries using the same cursor value.

When all results have been returned, the response will be an empty array and the `cursor` will return a value of `null`.
