# Items

`items` is where you will provide the columns you'd like returned from CMR.

```graphql
{
  concept {
    count
    items {
      conceptId
    }
  }
}
```

If you're querying single objects `count` is not available and therefore `items` isn't necessary -- you can simply list the columns you'd like returned from CMR as a direct child of your query.

```graphql
{
  concept {
    conceptId
  }
}
```

Note that the response you get will match the structure of your query, meaning that in the event you've requested data from a list query you'll receive the results in an `items` array whereas with a single query request you will not.
