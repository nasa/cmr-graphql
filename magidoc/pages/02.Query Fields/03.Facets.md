# Facets

`facets` will return the data provided by CMR determined by which facets you requested in your query. In order for this data to be provided by CMR you will need to include the `includeFacets` parameter in your query. For more information regarding facets refer to the [CMR documentation](https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/site/docs/search/api.html#facets). See below for a basic example:

```graphql
{
  collections(
    includeFacets:"v2"
  ) {
    facets
    items {
      conceptId
    }
  }
}
```
