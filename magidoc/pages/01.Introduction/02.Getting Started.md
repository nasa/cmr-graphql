# Getting Started

## Apollo Studio

The easiest way to get started using CMR GraphQL is using Apollo Studio, which is available at <{{graphqlUrl}}>.

Apollo Studio is a powerful GraphQL IDE in the cloud, offering intelligent features like autocomplete, schema exploration, and query building to enhance developer productivity.

## Programmatic access

There are many [GraphQL client libraries](https://graphql.org/community/tools-and-libraries/?tags=client) for many languages that will work with CMR GraphQL.

But any GraphQL Server can also be accessed by using a POST request as well.

```bash
curl -XPOST '{{graphqlUrl}}' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"query":"{ collections{ count}}"}'
```
