# Introduction

CMR GraphQL is an API developed by [NASA](http://nasa.gov) [EOSDIS](https://earthdata.nasa.gov) to search against [Common Metadata Repository (CMR)](https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/) concept metadata using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).

The CMR has a GraphQL API which can be queried with requests to {{graphqlUrl}}. The GraphQL API provides an alternative query language for the CMR REST API.

The CMR GraphQL API can retrieve individually requested fields from resources. For example a request with a list of specified fields from a collection would return the values for those fields but, not any other fields on the usual collections response from CMR. The CMR GraphQL can retrieve data from multiple resources from a single client request so in a single request, data from multiple resources such as the CMR REST API or the cmr-graphDb instance within a single client request.

## Example

Query:

```graphql
query Collections($params: CollectionsInput) {
  collections(params: $params) {
    items {
      conceptId
      shortName
    }
  }
}
```

Variables:

```graphql
{
  "params": {
    "shortName": "SENTINEL-1A_SLC"
  }
}
```

Response:

```graphql
{
  "data": {
    "collections": {
      "items": [
        {
          "conceptId": "C1214470488-ASF",
          "shortName": "SENTINEL-1A_SLC"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
