# Introduction

CMR GraphQL is an API developed by [NASA](http://nasa.gov) [EOSDIS](https://earthdata.nasa.gov) to search the [Common Metadata Repository (CMR)](https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/) concept metadata using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).

The CMR has a GraphQL API which can be queried with requests to {{graphqlUrl}}. The GraphQL API provides an alternative query language for the CMR REST API.

CMR GraphQL offers unified access to the Common Metadata Repository (CMR) API, providing a single GraphQL endpoint to query its diverse resources. By enabling precise data requests, you retrieve only the information you need, simplifying your workflows and accelerating your access to NASA's Earth Science data.

## Example

Query:

```graphql
query Collections($params: CollectionsInput) {
  collections(params: $params) {
    items {
      conceptId
      shortName
    }
  }
}
```

Variables:

```graphql
{
  "params": {
    "shortName": "SENTINEL-1A_SLC"
  }
}
```

Response:

```graphql
{
  "data": {
    "collections": {
      "items": [
        {
          "conceptId": "C1214470488-ASF",
          "shortName": "SENTINEL-1A_SLC"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
