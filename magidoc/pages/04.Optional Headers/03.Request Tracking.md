# Request Tracking

Logging is key to debugging, and to ensure that we can provide the best support to users' when issues may arise, CMR GraphQL supports the `X-Request-Id` header. This header will be passed to any CMR call made as part of the query which will be prepended to any CMR logs that are generated as a result of a query. This value is also used in CMR GraphQL logs so that we can associate our logs, CMR logs, and any logs you may have if debugging becomes necessary. We recommend setting this value with all requests in the event it is needed, it cannot be added retroactively.
