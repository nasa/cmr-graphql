# Identification

In order for us to best provide debugging, statistics, and to inform us of future feature work CMR GraphQL accepts the `Client-Id` header that allows all clients to identifiy themselves. If provided, this value is passed to any CMR call made as part of the query and is used to determine usage patterns, helps debug issues by filtering down logs, and also will help determine priority of feature requests.
