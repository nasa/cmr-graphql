# Authentication

CMR GraphQL accepts [Earthdata Login](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/) (EDL) tokens via the `Authorization` header. If provided, this token will be provided to any CMR call made as part of the query. CMR GraphQL will return errors if the token is invalid or expired in which case the client will need to handle the response accordingly.
